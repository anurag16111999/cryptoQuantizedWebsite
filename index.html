    <h1>CryptoQuantized</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      CryptoQuantized is an early-stage project focused on building internal
      infrastructure for quantitative research and experimentation in
      crypto markets.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>
      The work centers on tooling for strategy research rather than production
      trading. This includes backtesting ideas, running parameter sweeps,
      managing datasets, and keeping research results reproducible over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The objective is to reduce friction during the research phase so that
      ideas can be tested, discarded, or refined quickly without relying on
      long-running systems or manual processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Infrastructure Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Most workloads are bursty by nature: experiments run for short periods,
      consume significant compute, and are torn down once results are produced.
      The infrastructure is designed around this pattern rather than
      continuously running services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cloud services are used primarily for elastic compute, object storage
      for research artifacts, and isolated environments that make experiments
      easier to reproduce and reason about.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      CryptoQuantized is bootstrapped and in active development. The focus is
      currently on research workflows, infrastructure reliability, and
      validating assumptions before any external offering is considered.
